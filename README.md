# Scraping-Top-Repositories-for-Topics-on-GitHub
### Introduction about web scraping:
Web scraping is a technique used to extract information from websites. In this project, we're going to scrape GitHub to gather data about top repositories in various topics.

### Introduction about GitHub and the problem statement:
GitHub is a platform where developers collaborate on projects using version control. The problem we're addressing is the need to gather information about the top repositories in different topics for analysis or exploration.

### Tools you're using (Python, requests, Beautiful Soup, Pandas):
We'll be using Python as our programming language, along with the requests library to fetch web pages, Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML, and Pandas for organizing and storing the data.

## Now, let's break down the steps:

### Scraping https://github.com/topics:
Fetch the HTML content of the topics page using the requests library and parse it with Beautiful Soup.

### Get a list of topics:
Extract the topic title, topic page URL, and topic description from the parsed HTML.

## For each topic:

### Get the top 25 repositories:
Visit the topic page and extract the relevant information for each repository.
### For each repository:
Extract the repo name, username, stars, and repo URL.
Create a CSV file for each topic:
Organize the extracted data and create a CSV file for each topic with the specified format.
### Sample CSV entry:
##### Repo Name,Username,Stars,Repo URL
three.js,mrdoob,69700,https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js
libgdx,libgdx,18300,https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx
### Include a description for each repository:
Add a column for the repository description in the CSV file, and extract this information during the scraping process.
